My name is Matsuko Tamazuri. I am twenty-three and i am a student.
i study french and spanish at university in osaka where i grew up, but at the moment
i am learning in new york. When i first got here everything seemed different: the food,
the clothes and the weather. Now I enjoy it and it feels like home! I have a boyfriend called
josh. I met him three weeks ago when i was looking for a internet cafe! My hobbies are surfing
the net and singing. I sing every day? usually in the bathroom.
