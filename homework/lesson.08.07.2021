Prepare last experience from my work

Hi everyone, as you probably know, a few weeks ago i've finished work on the Cisco project, so i want to share my
impressions about it. Let speak about pros and cons. The first think that i want to say is the scope of the project.
He was really huge. I hadn't projects of this magnitude earlier. At first sight, it can seems good, but from other side,
this kind of projects are very difficult in development. Also i want to emphasize on odd technologies that were used on this
project, for me it was a big cons, because for the way that they are used is so uncomfortable and long. Fortunately i've
worked on this project only for a two month and after that our financing was stopped, and i was moved on the bench.
